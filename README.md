Basic Calculator:
This project is a basic calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing standard arithmetic operations and is designed to help users practice fundamental front-end development skills.

* Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure and layout of the calculator.

CSS: For styling the calculator, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface.

JavaScript: For implementing the core functionality, handling user input, and performing calculations.

* Project Difficulty Level
Hard - This project involves implementing complex logic for arithmetic operations, input handling, and basic error management.

* Project Description
This assignment focuses on creating a functional basic calculator. The primary goal is to develop an application capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Through this project, you will enhance your understanding of web technologies and gain practical experience in front-end development.

* Features
User Interface
Clear Display: A prominent display area for showing input and calculation results.

Digit Buttons: Buttons for digits 0-9 and a decimal point.

Operator Buttons: Dedicated buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Control Buttons: "Clear" button to reset the calculator and an "Equals" button to compute results.

Functionality
Core Arithmetic: Capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Order of Operations: The calculator adheres to the correct order of operations (e.g., BODMAS/BIDMAS) for accurate results.

Dynamic Input: Responds to both button clicks and keyboard input for seamless user interaction.

Error Handling
Division by Zero: Implements robust error handling for scenarios like division by zero.

Mathematical Errors: Handles other potential mathematical errors gracefully, providing informative feedback to the user.

* How to Use
Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your-Repository-URL]
cd basic-calculator

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Interact:

Click on the digit buttons (0-9) and the decimal point to enter numbers.

Click on operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform operations.

Press the "Clear" button to reset the display and current calculation.

Press the "Equals" button to see the result of your calculation.

You can also use your keyboard for input (numerical keys, operators, Enter for equals, Escape for clear).

* Extra Challenges (Optional Enhancements)
While the core requirements are met, you can further enhance this calculator by adding features such as:

Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.

Percentage Calculations: Implement percentage functionality.

Memory Functions: Add memory clear (MC), memory recall (MR), memory add (M+), and memory subtract (M-) features.

* Testing
The calculator has been thoroughly tested to ensure:

Accurate arithmetic calculations.

Correct order of operations.

Responsive input handling.

Reliable error handling for invalid operations.
